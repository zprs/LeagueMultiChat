# LeagueMultiChat
This application allows multiple users to type for another player in the League of Legends in game chat.

League Multi Chat is an electron application running node packages, socket.io, express, and robotjs. The application connects clients from across a network and transmits a message to be typed in chat. In order to type the message in chat, robotjs is emulating an enter key press, followed by the message, and terminated by another enter key press to send the message and close the chat box.

This application lies in a grey area in Riot's rules. Macros are not allowed and a bannable offense, however, there are many players who macros to quickly type things in chat, which is very similar to how this program works. Please keep this in mind and use at your own risk.
